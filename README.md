# Spark_Adafruit_LEDBackpack
Spark Core adaptation of Adafruit_LEDBackpack

This is my first attempt at C++, Spark Core and GitHub, so please be kind!

This is an adaptation of the Adafruit_LEDBAckpack library for Spark Core.

I have also added two features that improve the printing to the LED's.

Docs to follow.
